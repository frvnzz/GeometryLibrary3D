## About The Project
This program manages 3D geometric objects and performs computations on them. The application demonstrates the creation, manipulation, and display of these shapes. Information gets displayed through the Terminal and is color-coded for better readability.

### Built With
- **C#**
- **.NET 8.0 SDK** for development and execution/compilation

### Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure that you have the following installed:
- **[.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)**

### Installation

Clone the repository or download the source code from [here](https://github.com/frvnzz/GeometryLibrary3D/archive/refs/heads/main.zip):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/frvnzz/GeometryLibrary3D.git
   cd GeometryLibrary3D
```

### Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```bash
   dotnet run
```

This will display the usage information. You can provide specific arguments to specify the displayed information about different shapes:

-Cuboid  
-Tetrahedron  
-Cylinder  
-Composite  
-All

For example:

```bash
   dotnet run -All
```

This command will display information about all shapes in the composite shape, including their surface area, volume, and centroid.
